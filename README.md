# Thesis on Robust Clustering for Time Series.

This thesis is written in the Quarto environment, where it is possible to compile Latex, Python, R and Julia code.

### Chapter 2 (Preprocessing and Parameter Extraction) 

The proposed methodology includes outlier treatment in
multiple NDVI time series, feature extraction, and the use of robust unsupervised learning for
pattern detection in time series. In particular, the Hampel filter based on the MAD estimator
and the TCLUST algorithm as a robust clustering method are studied, 

### Chapter 3 (Clustering) 

Different unsupervised learning methods are analyzed in their non-robust and robust versions for simulated data and real data.

### Chapter 4 (Predictions of cultivated area)

identify the area planted with different
crops in Argentina, using time series of the NDVI vegetation index obtained from satellite
images of the agricultural territory.
